        <h1>Dragon Ball</h1>

        <p>Gokuu is a young boy who lives in the woods all aloneâ€”that is, until a girl named Bulma runs into him in her search
        for a set of magical objects called the "Dragon Balls." Since the artifacts are said to grant one wish to whoever
        collects all seven, Bulma hopes to gather them and wish for a perfect boyfriend. Gokuu happens to be in possession of a
        dragon ball, but unfortunately for Bulma, he refuses to part ways with it, so she makes him a deal: he can tag along on
        her journey if he lets her borrow the dragon ball's power. With that, the two set off on the journey of a lifetime.</p>

        <p>They don't go on the journey alone. On the way, they meet the old Muten-Roshi and wannabe disciple Kuririn, with whom
        Gokuu trains to become a stronger martial artist for the upcoming World Martial Arts Tournament. However, it's not all
        fun and games; the ability to make any wish come true is a powerful one, and there are others who would do much worse
        than just wishing for a boyfriend. To stop those who would try to abuse the legendary power, they train to become
        stronger fighters, using their newfound strength to help the people around them along the way.</p>
